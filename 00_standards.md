Impact On computing
9-12 IC 1  Evaluate the impact of computing technologies on equity, access, and influence in a global society.
Students will be asked to research an assigned computer scientist and research them. They will discover what their impact is either regarding programming, algorithms, software, hardware, internet and many other topics that this person was involved in. They will be asked to create a presentation to their classmates so that all will gain some knowledge on the history of these computer scientists and their impact in those fields.
Example portion of the lesson  below:
Directions: Choose one of the famous computer scientists listed below. Create a PowerPoint presentation about this person and what they helped to create or design. Your PowerPoint should have the following.

There should be a minimum of 5 – 8 slides in your presentation.
When were they born? Where were they born?
Where did they receive their education?
What are they famous for in the computer science field?
Did they receive any special awards or achievements? 
How can you relate the impact of what they created to what we use in society?
There should be 4 to 5 lines of information per slide. The intro slide does not need to have this many lines.
Have at least 3 images of the computer scientist you have been assigned.

Async discussion:
Sharing local school curriculum decisions.

We started offering computer science as an option for students at CTEA  in 2018. We initially only offered Computer Science Principles in 2018 to seniors and some juniors based on their math credits for graduation being completed. The programming language we used was SNAP with the BJC curriculum.
From 2019 -21 we expanded the offering of Computer Principles to sophomores each. In doing so we realized that the students in their senior year had no more options to choose from if they wanted to do another computed science course. Also to complicate matters we offered TEALs to Freshman students in which part of the program is borrowed from BJC Snap. This complicated matters because we had a low enrollment of Junior and Seniors for computer Principles  because they took SNAP in freshman year.
The new curriculum below that we are doing this school year is:
First course option -Presently for this school year 2022 we are offering Computation Media with Javascript P5 to the Freshman.
Second course option if they complete Javascript -Sophomores, Juniors and Senior can choose to take Python as their Computer Principles course.
Third course option if they complete Pythons  for Sophomores, Juniors and Seniors is Computer Science A where the students take Java.




Career Paths 9-12 IC.7  
Investigate the use of computer science in multiple fields. The focus on making connections between computer science and the fields of interest of individual students.

Summation: Students will be asked to research two computer fields they have an interest in. Once making the presentation they will search what the job is, the skills, knowledge, education involved as well as the pay scale. This will help to broaden the students’ knowledge of the various occupations in the computer science field.

Example of the lesson given below.

Create a PowerPoint Presentation based on your answers for the questions below. You are not limited to these questions in creating your presentation. You should do a compare and contrast for your two Computer Science jobs in your presentation.
Minimum 10 slides. 

Save as Computer Science jobs

What are the duties/responsibilities of the job? Describe in detail what they are.

Who or what do they interact and work with directly?

What must they have an understanding of?  (Examples; Hardware, software, programming languages, networks etc.)

What type of degree can they have outside of computer science if any?

What is the salary range?

Show images of the work environment and or equipment that they use incorporated into your answers above.

Reference the websites by making a bibliography page. You must have a minimum of 3 websites.
